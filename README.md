# multiclass-classification-using-ensemble-deep-learning

A model based on ensemble of CNNs and LightGBM for a multiclass classification problem. The training set contains 62,5k samples and 108 features and a target "y" integer corresponding to the class of the sample. The test set contains 150k samples and 108 features. There are a total of 9 classes and the goal is to minimize the categorical cross-entropy loss (log loss) and maximize the accuracy of our predictions.
